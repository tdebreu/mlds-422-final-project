## Final Project for MLDS-422: Movie Critic Rating Prediction Project
This project aims to predict movie critic ratings using data from a PostgreSQL database. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and building predictive models using Python.

## Repo Contents
#### Jupyter Notebook detailing the entire analysis workflow:
Data extraction, cleaning, and exploratory analysis
Feature engineering and model training
Performance evaluation of regression models

#### Data (pkl):
Dataset in .pkl format. Needs to be run through the .ipynb data cleaning process before modeling

#### Requirements.txt:
A requirements.txt file listing all the dependencies required to run the project.

#### Empty gitignore:
An empty .gitignore file excluding unnecessary files (e.g., .DS_Store, checkpoints) should I have them.

## Key Features
#### Data Cleaning & EDA:
Fixed erroneous years and analyzed trends in movie releases.
Visualized distributions and relationships among key features.
#### Feature Engineering:
Created new features like kid_friendly and genre-based interactions.
#### Predictive Modeling:
Built and evaluated six regression models, improving upon each iteration.
